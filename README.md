Marlow is a code generation tool written in [golang] designed to create useful constructs that provide an ergonomic API
for interacting with a project's data persistence layer while maintaining strong compile time type safety assurance.

### Objective &amp; Inspiration

Marlow was created to improve developer velocity on projects written in [golang] that interact with a data persistence
layer, like [mysql] or [postgres]. In other web application backend environments, these interfaces are usually
provided by an application framework's [ORM], like the [ActiveRecord] library used by [Rails].

For web applications leveraging the benefits of using [golang], it can be difficult to construct the equivalent
abstraction of their database that provides [crud] operations - especially one that is type-safe and [dry]. There are
several open source projects in the golang ecosystem who's goal is exactly that; [`gorm`], [`beego`], and  [`gorp`] to
name a [few][awesome-go]. Marlow differs from these other projects in its philosophy; rather than attempt to provide an
eloquent orm for your project at runtime, it generates a tailored solution at compile time.

### Usage

At its core, marlow simply reads a package's [field tags] and generates valid [golang] code. The `marlowc` executable 
can be installed & used directly via:

```
go get -u github.com/dadleyy/marlow/marlowc
marlowc -input=./examples/library/models -stdout=true
```

For a full list of options supported by the compiler refer to `marlowc -help`. The command line tool can also be used
as the executable target for golang's [`go generate`] command using `//go:generate` comment syntax:

```go
package models

//go:generate marlowc -input=book.go

type Book struct {
  ID       string `marlow="column=id"`
  AuthorID string `marlow="column=author_id"`
}
```

The generated files will live in the same directory as their source counterparts, with an optional suffix to 
distinguish them (useful if a project is using [`make`] to manage the build pipeline). In general it is encouraged that
the generated files **are not committed to your project's revision control**; the source should *always* be generated
immediately before the rest of the package's source code is compiled.

### Generated Code &amp; Field Tag Configuration

The compiler parses the `marlow` field tag value using the `net/url` package's [`parseQuery`] function. This means that
each configuration option supported by marlow would end up in delimited by the ampersand (`&`) character where the key 
and value are separated by an equal sign (`=`). For example, a user record may look like:

```go
package models

type User struct {
	table        string `marlow:"tableName=users"`
	ID           uint   `marlow:"column=id"`
	Name         string `marlow:"column=name"`
	Email        string `marlow:"column=email"`
	SettingsMask uint8  `marlow:"column=settings&bitmask"`
}
```

In this example, marlow would create the following `UserStore` interface in the `models` package:

```go
type UserStore interface {
	UpdateUserID(uint, *UserBlueprint) (int64, error)
	FindUsers(*UserBlueprint) ([]*User, error)
	SelectUserEmails(*UserBlueprint) ([]string, error)
	CreateUsers(...User) (int64, error)
	UpdateUserEmail(string, *UserBlueprint) (int64, error)
	DropUserSettingsMask(uint8, *UserBlueprint) (int64, error)
	UpdateUserName(string, *UserBlueprint) (int64, error)
	SelectUserNames(*UserBlueprint) ([]string, error)
	AddUserSettingsMask(uint8, *UserBlueprint) (int64, error)
	CountUsers(*UserBlueprint) (int, error)
	SelectUserIDs(*UserBlueprint) ([]uint, error)
	UpdateUserSettingsMask(uint8, *UserBlueprint) (int64, error)
	DeleteUsers(*UserBlueprint) (int64, error)
	SelectUserSettingsMasks(*UserBlueprint) ([]uint8, error)
}
```

For every store that is generated, marlow will create a "blueprint" struct that defines a set of fields to be used for
querying against the database. In this example, the `UserBlueprint` generated for the store above would look like:

```go
type UserBlueprint struct {
	IDRange           []uint
	ID                []uint
	NameLike          []string
	Name              []string
	EmailLike         []string
	Email             []string
	SettingsMaskRange []uint8
	SettingsMask      []uint8
	Inclusive         bool
	Limit             int
	Offset            int
	OrderBy           string
	OrderDirection    string
}
```

**Special `table` field**

If present, marlow will recognize the `table` field's `marlow` tag value as a container for developer specified 
overrides for default marlow assumptions about the table.

| Option | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `tableName` | The name of the table (marlow will assume a lowercased &amp; pluralized version of the struct name). |
| `dialect` | Specifying the `dialect` option determines the syntax used by marlow during db queries. See [supported-drivers](#supported-drivers) for more info. |
| `primaryKey` | Some dialects require that marlow knows of the table's primary key during transactions. If provided, this value will be used as the _column name_ by marlow. |
| `storeName` | The name of the store type that will be generated, defaults to `%sStore`, where `%s` is the name of the struct. |
| `blueprintName` | The name of the blueprint type that will be generated, defaults to `%sBlueprint`, where `%s` is the name of the struct. |
| `defaultLimit` | When using the queryable feature, this will be the default maximum number of records to load. |
| `blueprintRangeFieldSuffix` | A string that is added to numerical blueprint fields for range selections. Defults to `%sRange` where `%s` is the name of the field (e.g: `AuthorIDRange`). |
| `blueprintLikeFieldSuffix` | A string that is added to string/text blueprint fields for like selections. Defaults to `%sLike` where `%s` is the name of the field (e.g: `FirstNameLike`). |

**All other fields**

For every other field found on the source `struct`, marlow will use the following field tag values:

| Option | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `column` | This is the column that any raw sql generated will target when scanning/selecting/querying this field. |
| `autoIncrement` | If `true`, this flag will prevent marlow from generating sql during creation that would attempt to insert the value of the field for the column. |
| `bitmask` | If present, the compiler will generate `AddRecordFieldMask` and `DropRecordFieldMask` methods which will perform native bitwise operations as `UPDATE` queries to the datbase. |

#### Generated Coverage & Documentation

While everyone's generated marlow code will likely be unique, the [`examples/library`] application includes a
comprehensive test suite that demonstrates the features of marlow using 3 models - [`Author`], [`Book`] and [`Genre`].

Although generated documentation is not currently available (see [`GH-67`]), the html coverage reports for tagged 
builds can be found [here][generated-coverage.url]. There you will be able to see exactly what code is generated given
the models in the example app.

#### Supported Drivers

The follow is a list of officially support [`driver.Driver`] implementations supported by the generated marlow code. To request an additional driver, feel free to open up an [issue][issues].

| Driver Name | `dialect` Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| [`github.com/lib/pq`] | `postgres` | 
| [`github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3`] | none or `sql` | 
| [`github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql`] | none or `sql` |
